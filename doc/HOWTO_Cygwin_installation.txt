This file file describes how to do a minimal Cygwin installation, 
that still includes all dependencies of SpeciesGeoCoder.

A few extra programs needs to be installed on a Windows computer to 
make it run SpeciesGeoCoder. These programs inscudes a command 
interpreter, also known as a shell, the programming language Python 
as well as a number of tools for compiling the GDAL library, that is 
used for extracting elevation data from geotif files. The Cygwin 
package provides these programs and an easy way of installing a 
GNU/Linux-like environment on a Widows computer. This HOWTO describes 
the installation process of a Cygwin system on Windows XP/Vista/7/.

3. Run the downloaded setup program and accept all defaults until 
   the "Choose A Download Site" page appears. Choose a server close 
   to your location and click "next".
4. Ignore the installation alert If this is the first time you install 
   Cygwin on your computer.

6. Click "next" twice and sit back while the packages are downloaded 
   and installed on your computer.
